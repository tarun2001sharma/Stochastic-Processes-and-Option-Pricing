## Problem Details and Solutions

### 1. Simulation of Brownian Motion Paths

#### Theory
Brownian Motion $W_t$, also called Wiener Process, is a key building block in stochastic calculus. It has the following properties:
1. $W_0 = 0$
2. Independent increments
3. Normally distributed increments, $W_t - W_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$ for $t > s$
4. Continuous sample paths

Discrete-time simulation uses:

$$
W_{t_{i+1}} = W_{t_i} + \sqrt{\delta t} Z_i, \quad Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

#### Tasks
1. Implement a function `simulate_brownian_motion` to simulate multiple paths of $W_t$ over a given time horizon using a discrete approximation.
2. For $20,000$ paths:
   - Estimate $E(W_t)$, the expected value at each time step.
   - Compute $\sqrt{\text{Var}(W_t)}$, the standard deviation.
3. Plot:
   - The estimated mean and standard deviation at each time step.
   - Overlay theoretical values: $E(W_t) = 0$ and $\sqrt{\text{Var}(W_t)} = \sqrt{t}$.

#### Insights
- The simulated values validate the theoretical properties of Brownian Motion.
- Accuracy improves with more paths and finer time discretization.

### 2. Simulation of Black-Scholes Paths

#### Theory
The Black-Scholes model builds on the principles of Brownian Motion and models the dynamics of asset prices $S_t$ using a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). The GBM incorporates two key components:
1. **Drift ($\mu$)**: The deterministic growth rate of the asset price.
2. **Volatility ($\sigma$)**: The magnitude of randomness in price fluctuations, derived from Brownian Motion.

The stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the price dynamics is:

$$
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu \, dt + \sigma \, dW_t
$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the drift (expected return of the asset),
- $\sigma$ is the volatility (measure of uncertainty or risk),
- $W_t$ is a Wiener process (Brownian Motion).

The SDE can be solved analytically to give the closed-form solution for $S_t$:

$$
S_t = S_0 \exp \left( \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) t + \sigma W_t \right)
$$

In numerical simulations, time is discretized into $N$ steps with step size $\delta t$, allowing us to approximate the continuous dynamics:

$$
S_{t_{i+1}} = S_{t_i} \exp \left[ \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) \delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} Z_i \right]
$$

Here:
- $\delta t = \frac{T}{N}$ is the time step,
- $Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ are independent standard normal random variables,
- $\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2$ is the drift adjustment term accounting for the variance effect in log-normal distribution.

#### Key Properties of the Black-Scholes Model
1. **Log-Normal Distribution**: The asset price $S_t$ follows a log-normal distribution:
   $$ \ln(S_t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\ln(S_0) + \left(\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2\right)t, \, \sigma^2 t\right) $$
2. **Expected Value**:
   $$ \mathbb{E}[S_t] = S_0 e^{\mu t} $$
3. **Variance**:
   $$ \text{Var}(S_t) = S_0^2 e^{2\mu t} \left(e^{\sigma^2 t} - 1\right) $$

These properties validate the modelâ€™s ability to capture the stochastic growth of asset prices while preserving the randomness introduced by market forces.

#### Tasks
1. Simulate multiple paths of $S_t$ under the following parameters:
   - Initial price $S_0 = 100$,
   - Drift $\mu = 5\%$,
   - Volatility $\sigma = 30\%$,
   - Risk-free rate $r = 3\%$,
   - Time horizon $T = 1$ year,
   - Daily time steps ($\delta t = 1/360$).

2. Analyze:
   - The geometric properties of the simulated paths,
   - The influence of drift and volatility on asset price dynamics.

### 3. Pricing by Simulation

#### Theory
The price of a European call option is given by:

$$
C = e^{-rT} \mathbb{E}\left[\max(S_T - K, 0)\right]
$$

Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate this expectation by generating paths for $S_T$.

#### Tasks
1. Simulate $S_T$ for multiple paths and calculate the discounted payoff for a strike price $K = 100$.
2. Repeat the simulation for two additional strike prices and analyze:
   - Mean price
   - Standard deviation and standard error
3. Study the impact of increasing the number of paths on the price estimates and error bars.

#### Insights
- Option price decreases as the strike price increases, reflecting reduced payoff probability.
- Increasing paths reduces standard error, demonstrating the convergence property of Monte Carlo simulations.

### 4. Simulation of Hedging

#### Theory
Delta hedging replicates the option payoff using a portfolio:

$$
P_t = \Delta_t S_t + \phi_t B_t
$$

where:
- $\Delta_t = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S}$ adjusts for price sensitivity.
- $B_t$ represents a bond component to balance the portfolio.

#### Tasks
1. Simulate daily portfolio values $P_t$ and compare with the theoretical option price $C_{BS}$ for various paths.
2. Plot:
   - $P_t$ vs. $C_{BS}$
   - Histogram of hedging errors $\varepsilon_T = P_T - \text{Payoff}$
   - Include mean $E(\varepsilon_T)$ and variance $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_T)$ on plots.

#### Insights
- Hedging errors arise from discretization and model assumptions.
- Errors decrease with finer time steps and accurate volatility estimates.

### 5. Behavior of Hedging Error

#### Theory
Hedging errors depend on parameters like:
- Drift $\mu$
- Volatility $\sigma$
- Time step $\delta t$

#### Tasks
1. Analyze the impact of:
   - Increasing $\mu$ from $5\%$ to $20\%$.
   - Increasing $\sigma$ up to $80\%$.
   - Reducing time steps ($\delta t = 1/60$, $1/30$).
2. Plot histograms of hedging errors under varying conditions.

#### Insights
- Hedging errors increase with higher volatility.
- Larger time steps exacerbate discrepancies, highlighting the importance of frequent rebalancing.

### 6. Estimation of Volatility

#### Theory
Volatility can be estimated via:
1. **Historical Volatility**:

$$
\text{Historical Volatility} = \frac{360}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_{t_i} - X_{t_{i-1}})^2
$$

2. **Break-Even Volatility**: The volatility that perfectly hedges an at-the-money call.

#### Tasks
1. Plot historical volatility for paths of $S_t$ as $n$ increases.
2. Compute the break-even volatility over 10,000 paths and plot its distribution.

#### Insights
- Historical volatility converges with finer time discretization.
- Break-even volatility highlights sensitivity to model calibration.

### 7. Holding Value by Simulation

#### Theory
The holding value at $t = 0.5Y$ depends on:
- The value of the underlying $S_t$.
- The expected discounted payoff from $t$ to $T$.

#### Tasks
1. Simulate paths for $S_t$, evaluate payoffs, and collect data.
2. Use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to approximate the conditional expectation of the payoff as a function of $S_t$ using basis functions.
3. Compare approximations with the Black-Scholes formula.

#### Insights
- OLS regression provides a data-driven alternative to closed-form solutions.
- Increasing the number of basis functions improves the approximation.
